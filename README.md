<h1> Calculator in HTML, JS and CSS </h1>
> Status: Complete

  This calculator performs simple calculations, namely: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Once you apply the code in your text editor, you should run it in a web application like google chrome.
  I don't know if it's actually the right way... but each code of each language must be placed in the same script, just creating its respective field, for example:
To put the JS part of the code, create one:

. code in html

For the JS: 
<script>
. put the JS code here
</script> 
\
For the CSS:
<style>
. css code
</style>
