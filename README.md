<h1> Calculator in HTML, JS and CSS </h1>
> Status: Complete

  This calculator performs simple calculations, namely: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After applying the code in your text editor you have to run it in a web app like google chrome.
  I don't know if it's really the correct way... but the CSS must be placed in the same script, just creating its respective field:

. code in html

For the JS: 
. the java script code is already linked with the HTML
\
For the CSS:
<style>
. css code
</style>
